# CrazyEight
This is a card game Crazy Eight which is a simpler version of Uno.

Instruction: 

The game is played with two standard 52-card decks, so there are two instances of each card. At least two players are required, 
and each player is dealt seven cards from the shuffled double-deck. One card is placed face up for all to see.

Each player plays a card that either matches the suit or value of the face-up card. So if the face- up card is a Jack of Clubs, 
the current player may play any Jack or any Club (including the other Jack of Clubs). Alternatively, the player may play any Eight,
which acts as a wildcard. The player playing the Eight then announces the suit that the card will act as, which does not have to be 
the suit that is actually on the card. Play then goes to the next player, who must repeat the process. That is, she must play a 
card matching the suit or value of the new face-up card, play a card of the called suit if the previous player put down an Eight, 
or play an Eight herself. The winner is the first player to have no cards remaining.

If a player has no playable cards in her hand, she must draw from the deck until she can play something. A player can only pass if 
there are no cards remaining to draw. However, a player may choose to draw as many cards as she wants on her turn, even if she has 
a playable card in her hand.
